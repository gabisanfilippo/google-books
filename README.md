## Overview

Google Books Explorer is a user-friendly web application to search and explore book details using the Google Books API. It is a two-step process where you can search for a book by name in the first step and then click on a book to get more detailed information in the second step.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **NextJS**: A React.js framework for server-rendered or statically-exported JavaScript apps.
- **Axios**: A popular, promise-based HTTP client that sports an easy-to-use API and can be used in both the browser and Node.js.
- **Moment**: A library that allows for the parsing, validating, manipulating, and displaying of dates and times in JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast and scaleable bearbones state-management solution.
- **Typescript**: An open-source language which builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.
